# Aalya's Prototype Shield Documentation

## Step-By-Step Tutorial

### Brainstorming & Establishing Requirements

Before we get into the physical work of connecting and soldering everything on the prototype shield, we must first understand where everything goes. In this particular case, we are working with a radio that will be recieving transmissions. The radio itself consists of three main elements: a row that connects to power, a row that connects to ground, and a row that for the signals in the radio. That means that we are going to need 3 rows of header pins connected to the board: a place for the radio to connect to.

Next, we need to think of the wiring. What pins should connect to what element in the radio?
