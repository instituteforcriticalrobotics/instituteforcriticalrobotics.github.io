The [lighthouse system](https://kevinlynagh.com/lighthouse/) is based on
precise timing of near-infrared light pulses. A base station (“lighthouse”)
emits a wide field of view sync pulse and then sweeps either a horizontal or
vertical beam. A receiver uses the duration between the sync and sweep pulses
to determine its horizontal/vertical angular position with respect to the
lighthouse. It uses off-the-shelf lighthouses designed for VR systems
