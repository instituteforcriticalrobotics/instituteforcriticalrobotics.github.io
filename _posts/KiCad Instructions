#How To Use KiCad

##[1] Introduction
- Make a directory or use Github repository
  2 options come up: Schematic (EESchema) and Layout

##[2] Schematic Symbol
- Either access the symbol editor and find the specific component or create a non-existing component

##[3] Making A Schematic
- (A) Opens up the symbol library to choose, select and place components into the schematic
 *(C) Duplicates a component
 *(R) Rotates a component
- Assign specific values to each component on the schematic by right-clicking the component, opening th properties menu 
  and selecting the value feature to input value (Or by using V as a shortcut)
- (W) runs wires/ connectoin between components
- Use the symbol library to select the power flag and the ground symbols (Down arrow). This is a common feature missed out in most circuits
  and is picked up as an error. Each component that needs to be grounded should go to a ground (multiple ground symbols still connect
  to one ground) and all the power sources are specified using a powerflag. Connections that do not go anywhere should have a no connection
  symbol (an X)
- Once all the components are placed and connected correctly, use the Electrical Rules Calculator to double-check the connections
 * The ERC feature is located in the top toolbar on the right
-Annotate the components in the annotation menu. This is done to differentiate each component in theschematic and to fully define it
 * The Annotation feature is located directly on the right of the ERC
