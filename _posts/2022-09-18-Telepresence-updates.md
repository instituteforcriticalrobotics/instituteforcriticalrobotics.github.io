# Amina's updates on the telepresence robot

# Nov 5: SerialPort for Node.JS

After installing the SerialPort npm library, modified code to read from the Arduino port and transfer information:

````
// Create an Arduino port
const port = new SerialPort({
  path: '/dev/cu.usbmodem14201', // change this depending on Raspberry Pi port: /dev/ttyACM0
  baudRate: 9600, // change this depending on Raspberry Pi baudRate
});

port.write('main screen turn on', function(err) {
  if (err) {
    return console.log('Error on write: ', err.message);
  }
  console.log('message written');
});

// Open errors will be emitted as an error event
port.on('error', function(err) {
  console.log('Error: ', err.message)
})
````

[From ITP tutorial](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/labs-serial-communication/lab-serial-communication-with-node-js/): "The serialport library, like most node.js libraries, is event-based. This means that when the program is running, the operating system and the userâ€™s actions will generate events and the program will provide functions to deal with those events called callback functions."

First results: and it looks like the message is going through! Now I only need to find how to receive that from the Arduino's side...

# Nov 4

- Watched a video on raspi and arduino communication. Questions:
  - Does the communication only work via Python? In the video and other resources, the communication always seemed to use Python.
- Q: How to wire up raspi and arduino? After that will be a part of starting a server from raspi
- Installed SerialPort Nodejs npm library. More info: https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialport 

# Nov 3

## Priority task:
1) Start up the node server from RasPi
2) Read web commands to be fed to Arduino
3) Transmit web commands from the RasPi server to Arduino

Done:
- read through serial communication: https://roboticsbackend.com/raspberry-pi-arduino-serial-communication/#:~:text=The%20easiest%20way%20is%20to,Arduino%20IDE)%20to%20your%20board.

# Oct 24th-30th Weekly Update:

I've spent the majority of the time this week working on understanding SSL and networking for webRTC. To install SSL, we need to purchase a certificate to be used on both client and server when transmitting data through getUserMedia() function used in webRTC. Without HTTPS connection and SSL that is required for that connection, the two-way interaction process will not be possible. The next step would be to purchase an SSL certificate to establish safe connection.

This makes me consider 2 independent things:
1. Do we want webRTC to be used as a primary way of two-way interaction? I understand this codebase was first created in 2017-18, during the times where digital tools like Zoom and Google Meet were not widely accessible. If we eliminate the problem of two-way connection by using a third-party video conferencing and focus just on transmitting Arduino commands to Raspberry Pi, will this still be helpful in the research? Or does it break the initial intention of using webRTC?
2. My progress with figuring out network connections is rather slow due to my understanding of the topic and my own schedule this semester, i.e. I spent the majority of the time I have on understanding the theory instead of problem-solving. I anticipate getting more time this J-term and Spring 2023 semester, with grad school applications and the majority of the Capstone being out of the way. While I am also waiting on external help with networking, is it a possibility for me to temporarily switch to the website-building pending task from the [ICR to-do list](https://instituteforcriticalrobotics.github.io/2022/09/16/Task-list.html)? I feel confident about finishing a personal website for Michael in the remainder of the semester and do not anticipate any heavy technical blockers with this. Let me know if this is something you/ICR team can consider. Of course, I will still try to figure out networking for webRTC, and hopefully this will be resolved in the next few months.

# Oct 30 Summary

## Helpful instruction on installing SSL on Linux
- How to install SSL connection on [Ubuntu](https://www.filecloud.com/supportdocs/fcdoc/latest/server/filecloud-administrator-guide/installing-filecloud-server/post-installation/ssl-configuration/use-ssl-on-linux/install-an-ssl-certificate-on-ubuntu)
- How do we purchase an SSL certificate? That would be the next step.

# Oct 28 Summary
- [x] Watched SSL video explanations https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJJmoDZ3il8&ab_channel=dtommy1979 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33VYnE7Bzpk&ab_channel=SunnyClassroom
- [x] Found this as a proof of Jack's hypothesis from last time: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41922515/webrtc-video-streaming-doesnt-work-through-http
- [x] webRTC x HTTPS findings: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43901648/webrtc-over-https-issue  

- Ask Michael: is there a particular reason why we don't use Zoom or Google Meets for this project? If third-party video-audio connection is used, can arduino commands live on a separate website? Trying to gauge the optimal way to solve this.
- Slowly progressing, will work on this a bit more in-depth over the weekend! 

# Weekly Update
- Debugging in progress:
  As of now, there are two identified issues:
  1. An HTTPS connection is required for a two-way interaction when testing
  2. Client media stream sharing isn't sending data as expected
  If I get time during Fall break, I will look into #2. Otherwise, I will get back to it after Oct 23rd.

# Oct 13 debugging with Jack:

Summary: there are two separate problems
1) with HTTPS (localhost + non-local connection won't peer connect to each other even if the code is perfect)
2) because http://10.225.22.40:8080/ doesn't work by itself (outside of localhost), there's definitely sth wrong with the codebase. I am looking into this now

Other discussed points:
- how do we know it's creating the offer on the server? if the video is shown, then probably the call is going through?
- https secure connections may impact // look into hosting in https // get a license, can do both locally and raspi
- install ssl license https://www.thesslstore.com/knowledgebase/ssl-install/whm-ssl-installation/

Investigation notes:
- As determined from the codebase, robot sends the video data, but client never shares their video/audio data. Hence we're not able to pull up the client video/audio. The next step in solving this would be to get the client share this data, but that would only work in a safe HTTPS connection. See notes from above for details on how to set this up.

# Oct 9 debugging:
- Stuck, ouch! Cannot find a way to output client video on a robot's side. Watched multiple tutorials, but get lost in actual implementation in the existing codebase. Tutorials seem to use different/potentially updated formatting in webRTC and I don't understand how to map to our state. Perhaps it's time to ask for help from Jack.

# Oct 7 updates:
- Created separate CSS file for storing the styles and refactoring the code to maintain standard web dev coding practices.
- Refactoring HTML to show both videos and having options to see the client name and if they wish to mute audio/video.

# Oct 6:
- Requested necessary equipment for raspi testing from the IM Lab. Pickup available on Oct 10th (no earlier slots). The return time is on Oct 13th -- is it possible to extend for research purposes? 
- Still slightly confused about server connection on raspi. So questions for me to research/answer:
  - Starting a server on raspi from Node
  - Reading from a server on raspi
  - Requesting audio connection from client to output on robot -- how is this feasible with webRTC? Lookup tutorials and test.

Client audio/video setup:
- testing two-way connection but to no success yet; debugging and researching best connection options.
- do we want to make that available by default or give the user an option to choose?
- I am tempted to follow a tutorial for establishing a two-way connection since it seems clearer than the existing setup...

Focus for next time:
- debugging two-way connection
- collect camera and microphone for raspi
- raspi network connection
     

# Oct 4 Goals Updates:
- Two-way interaction between server and client:
  - right now client sees and hears the robot; but robot can't see and hear the client.
- Raspi connection to server and testing from raspi directly, rather than locally.
- Raspi receiving arduino commands and responding to them.

# Oct 1 Summary:
- Browsing information about raspi and sockets; so the goal is to make raspi read from the server or to start a server on its own?
- if it starts a server, then it needs socket programming; [this video is a good example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QihjI84Z2tQ)
- correct if my understanding is wrong: robot (raspi) starts the server; client connects and sees the video and audio with webRTC; client can press buttons and that will trigger raspi to respond by sending info to arduino.

# Sep 29 Summary:
- Discovered that on the client's side audio was muted; enabled it.
- Do we need the audio to play on the robot's side? Disabled it on robot but in a way that still plays on client.
- Testing continued with Aalya!
- Now that's audio is fixed, figuring out the server situation on Raspberry Pi. Helpful links found:

  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt5_9h84CrQ
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22036754/send-data-from-raspberrypi-to-webserver - this looks kind of helpful
- Question to Michael: what do you mean when one presses "stop"? Stop the motors from running? Pause the video? Exit from the web-page?
- TO-DO:
  - [ ] raspi connection to server and then to arduino
  - [ ] fix UI/UX after improved functionality
  - [ ] clean up the code into functions

# Sep 27 Summary:
- Good news: the audio now works on the robot's side -- do we need this? Should the audio only work on the client's side? Investigate that further.

# Sep 25 Meeting notes:
- Check with Alia Waleed on last semester's codebase for network connection
- Completed the Raspberry Pi setup on the computer
- Merged pull request
- Continue with debugging and meet in two weeks

# Sep 24 Summary:
- In webrtc.js there indeed was a line (75) that never asked for microphone permission! I will toggle the audio to true and see what happens.
  - Created a pull request with changes -> ask Michael to invite me as a collaborator to the repository. Otherwise, I am unable to test the changes.
- Was able to progress in understanding a bit thanks to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmR9IMUD_CY). However, still don't understand the receiver/client/non-robot part of the video -- need to dig deeper through the codebase.
- Question to Michael: can there be more than one client/non-robot interactor? If so, how would that be ensured? Right now it seems like anyone can join and take "control" of the Arduino. What if there are conflicts?
- What is the difference between [this telepresence repository](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/telepresence) and [this with webRTC](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/webRTC)? The first one is the one with Python code.
- As far as it seems, pressing on buttons doesn't work because they aren't really connected to the Arduino code. In the backend, the button commands aren't linked with Arduino-specific commands, so that's why we get the error message. To fix this, we need to define these commands in the backend and link the code/codebases.

# Sep 22-23 Summary
- Checking if the website uses microphone:
  - so the website asks for the video permission in the beginning, but never does so for the microphone, so it's never initialized. this is why (my guess) we hear no audio (see screenshot attached). But this doesn't seem to resolve it.
- here's what I found as well "you need to open and forward UDP ports 9100-9199 to the pbx in firewall/router for the audio." (https://www.3cx.com/community/threads/webrtc-no-audio.40818/)
- A lot of [workarounds/fixes](https://community.asterisk.org/t/asterisk-16-4-webrtc-no-audio/83624) for audio involve diving into SIP trace / server / http config settings. I have little understanding of this, so perhaps should schedule some time with Jack to see if I can get help
- "All WebRTC clients are inside local network, so ICE isn't needed here. But the bad way - ICE is the problem here. I've made a lot of tests and found that if call initiator is Web RTC client and there is some delay in answer (10-25 seconds) - audio is completely absent. Also in this case in RTP debug can be seen than "sent RTP packet" doesn't have "via ICE" mark. But when call initiator is any SIP client (X-Lite, Ekiga, etc) - WebRTC works perfectly. And the answer (as I think) is in rtcp-mux - wich can't do Asterisk but Sofia (SIP library for FreeSwitch) can"
- Should I follow a new tutorial to replicate this?

# Sep 20 Summary
- [x] Tested video output with home-setup
- [x] Researched JS and HTML documentation for sound output [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content). Continue looking more into this next time.
- [x] Looked into sound changes in the codebase -- all looks fine 
- [x] Planned for debugging and sound testing with non-webRTC video

Focus for next time:
- Ask if audio ever worked?
- Add sound/video source to test on both devices

## Testing findings:
- Safari + iPhone connection doesn't work; while Chrome + iPhone works but without the sound
- What I can test: if the audio works at all => play some sound (or better -- a pre-loaded video with sound) when the client joins the conference; this can show if this is a browser issue or webRTC one

## Investigating why webRTC isn't working:
- "Starting with Asterisk 12 you need to have pjproject libraries installed, otherwise you most likely won't have audio in your WebRTC calls and no warning whatsoever!" [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28501309/no-audio-in-webrtc-and-asterisk)
- "First question: have you ensured all firewall configs permit RTP streams from the chosen STUN / ICE server unconditionally? My own experience is that audio issues with WebRTC are almost always related to STUN / ICE & Firewall."

# Sep 18 Summary

## Meeting notes:
- [x] Got server to work on Amina's laptop
- [x] Clarified questions with Michael
- [x] Laptop question -- figuring out + IM lab/CAT might be able to help 

## Understanding notes:

Telepresence system consists of webRTC and Arduino, where server = web server and client = video + audio software for the robot (2 clients in total = robot and device).

### WebRTC:
- Send data through API's
- Client <-> Server <-> Client
- Transferring audio+video object for privacy

## Clarification points:
- How is the system intended to work and where does Arduino come in?
- Does the robot needs constructing at this time or is the main priority for now the software fix?
- How to power up computer to robot? How does it work remotely?
- Which network does the robot connect to?
- Ask Michael for a work laptop -- mine can't handle any more software :(

## Brainstorm around why the audio doesn't work:
- Buggy code?
- Browser issues? E.g. Chrome sometimes blocks external audio
- Network issues? Drop somewhere in the communication to server process?
