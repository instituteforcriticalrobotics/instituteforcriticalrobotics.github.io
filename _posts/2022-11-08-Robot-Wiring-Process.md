NP = NeoPixel (the interface screen)  
MXS = MaxSonar (the sonar distance sensors)

## Modification

The MaxSonar sensors are connected to each other and there is an extra wire which needs to also be connected somewhere. I'm not sure where yet. 

## Sketching

To begin, we must first understand all the different components found in the robot so that we can play how to wire everything up in a way that is most efficient. Below is a rough sketch that includes all the parts of the robot and all the different wiring required for it.
